					<div class="main-about-text">
						<p>For my senior capstone project (completed as a junior), I was part of a team that created an internal-facing data dashboard that allows Court Watch Nola, a New Orleans-based non-profit, to efficiently query their data and create customizable visualizations. </p>

						<p><a href="https://www.courtwatchnola.org">Court Watch NOLA</a>(CWN) is a non-profit organization located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is "dedicated to promoting transparency, equity, and justice through tracking, observing, and reporting thousands of criminal court cases a year." CWN sends well-trained observers into court sessions of all three Orleans Parish court systems (Magistrate, Criminal District Court, and Municipal). These observers fill out court-specific surveys, which are then uploaded to a popular survey data collection website. </p>

						<p>During my participation in the 2022 Future Computing Summer Internship with the National Security Agency, I was part of a team conducting research into the use of machine learning for classifying and generating <i>auxillary arrays</i> for the <i>Reverse Ising Problem</i>. We used discriminatory machine learning models to classify candidate auxillary arrays as either feasible (i.e. a representation that leads to an Ising Circuit that is computationally accurate), or infeasible; we used generative machine learning models--trained on feasible auxillary arrays found by other methods--to generate additional feasible arrays; additionally, we used reinforcement machine learning to teach an agent how to discover feasible arrays. </p>

						<p> My main contributions to the project were 1) the development of Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) to generate feasible auxillary arrays and 2) the development of a novel reinforcement learning approach for discovering auxillary arrays. </p>

						<p> It is commonplace for law firms to regularly issue press releases. For one local law firm, I am building out a press release management and optimization software. </p>

						<p> The firm uses several different services to issue press releases about cases they are currently working on. For these releases, they have a set budget they are willing to use and each service has their own set of rules pertaining to release frequency, quantity, etc. The budget and the service rules add dozens of constraints that make manually finding the optimal schedule impossible. In a business where any press release has the potential to attract a valuable client, maximizing the number of press releases according to these constraints is invaluable. </p>

						<p> This scheduling problem can be represented as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem">Constraint Satisfaction Problem</a> (CSP). As such, I have implemented a constraint model to maximize the <i>Egalitarian Welfare</i> of the firm's active cases' press releases (i.e. an algorithm that, given active cases and deadlines, maximizes the minimum occuring case). Currently, I am in the process of building a supporting Django web application to support the user side and data processing requirements of a practical solution to the problem. </p>

						<p>  For my Software Studio class (Fall 2021), our semester long project was to build a website using Ruby on Rails. My group built DreamCatcher, a website that allows people to input and track their dreams, as well as explore others' dreams.</p>

						<p> Given our time frame, team size, and novice web development experience entering the semester, DreamCatcher is a relatively complete SQL Database-backed website that allows for profile creation and login/logout functionality. Once a user has created their profile, they can enter new dreams from the "New Dream" page; here, they can mark the dream as "Public" or "Private." All dreams marked public are shown on the "Explore" page, making DreamCatcher a dream social media of sorts. DreamCatcher also supports searching--users can enter a phrase in the search bar to search for all public dreams matching their search phrase. </p>

						<p>  Companies are always getting sued for fraudulent behavior regarding the manipulation of their stock prices in what are known as securities class action lawsuits. A common investing adage is "buy low, sell high." Quite often, law suits against a company of any sort have a negative affect on stock prices. I wondered, then, do enough investors buy stock in these sued companies to eventually increase the stock? What are the trends? In the below notebook, I investigated this theory as a side project.</p>

						<p> I have been involved with Cookies & Code, Tulane's computer science club, since I was a freshman. This year I am the President of the club, and, for the first time, Cookies & Code is introducing a tier-based membership system. Members gain points by attending our weekly events and meetings. Certain point thresholds correspond to certain membership tiers. </p>

						<p> I wanted a system that would automatically updates members' points and allows members to view their attendance records and membership tier throughout the semester. As such, I updated our existing club website (shoutout to our former president Jake Lehner for the initial creation of this website). I developed several backend features of the website, including account, login, and automatic attendance tracking functionality. I downloaded our club roster from Tulane's student organization website and programtically created a profile on the website for our 300+ members. </p>

					<h3> Description: </h3>
					<div class="main-about-text">
						<p> As the Vice President of Cookies & Code during my Junior year, I organized, advertised, and led an event called "Learn to Hack." At this event, I discussed hacking (in general), the importance of cybersecurity (as it relates to hacking), and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. During this event, I led several activities in which participants completed a stack overflow attack against an actual stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in a network management software called ConnMan (the attack was against a simulated IoT device of the particpant's creation and did not cause any damage to any other systems!).</p>

						<p> <i>A lot</i> of preparation went into this event. For starters, I had to brush up some lower level computing knowledge : processes, programs, stacks, stack frames, etc. I was familiar with the specific attack and vulnerability that I used in the activity from my research at UNC Charlotte over the past summer. In fact, the actual exploits used during this activity were written by me during that reserach. The biggest challenge with putting on this event was coordinating 20+ people--many with no knowledge of exploit development or cybersecurity--to complete an advanced exploit <i>safely</i> and <i>quickly</i>. I wanted to avoid participants having to issue any commands on their own computer, as doing so prevents obvious hazards in such an event. Additionally, I didn't want participants to have to install any software whatsoever, as doing so during an event is very unlikely to work (given the differing levels of expertise and different operating systems being used).</p>

						<p> The exploit relies on using a host machine to target a simulated IoT device running ConnMan, the vulnerable software. My solution was to create an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI), which is an AWS virtual machine; in my design, the AMI acts as the host machine while the simulated IoT device is a Docker Container. I installed Docker on the AMI and ssh'd over necessary scripts for the avticity's exploits, such as the Dockerfile to set up the Container and a malicious DNS server python script. With one AMI properly configured for the event, I made 40 copies. Accessing an AMI requires two things: 1) a .pem file and 2) a specific, unique command to enter on your host machine. For the event, I created a master spreadsheet that included both (1) and (2) for all 40 of the AMI's. I created a master document (shown below) that included instructions for accessing an AMI, in addition to all necessary commands for the exploit. The instructions in this document were both explicit and clear enough that participants with nearly 0 computer science experience were able to complete the activities and walk away with some knowledge. </p>
