						<p> I have been involved with Cookies & Code, Tulane's computer science club, since I was a freshman. This year I am the President of the club, and, for the first time, Cookies & Code is introducing a tier-based membership system. Members gain points by attending our weekly events and meetings. Certain point thresholds correspond to certain membership tiers. </p>

						<p> I wanted a system that would automatically updates members' points and allows members to view their attendance records and membership tier throughout the semester. As such, I updated our existing club website (shoutout to our former president Jake Lehner for the initial creation of this website). I developed several backend features of the website, including account, login, and automatic attendance tracking functionality. I downloaded our club roster from Tulane's student organization website and programtically created a profile on the website for our 300+ members. </p>

					<h3> Description: </h3>
					<div class="main-about-text">
						<p> As the Vice President of Cookies & Code during my Junior year, I organized, advertised, and led an event called "Learn to Hack." At this event, I discussed hacking (in general), the importance of cybersecurity (as it relates to hacking), and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. During this event, I led several activities in which participants completed a stack overflow attack against an actual stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in a network management software called ConnMan (the attack was against a simulated IoT device of the particpant's creation and did not cause any damage to any other systems).</p>

						<p> <i>A lot</i> of preparation went into this event. For starters, I had to brush up some lower level computing knowledge : processes, programs, stacks, stack frames, etc. I was familiar with the specific attack and vulnerability that I used in the activity from my research at UNC Charlotte over the past summer. In fact, the actual exploits used during this activity were written by me during that reserach. The biggest challenge with putting on this event was coordinating 20+ people--many with no knowledge of exploit development or cybersecurity--to complete an advanced exploit <i>safely</i> and <i>quickly</i>. I wanted to avoid participants having to issue any commands on their own computer, as doing so prevents obvious hazards in such an event. Additionally, I didn't want participants to have to install any software whatsoever, as doing so during an event is very unlikely to work (given the differing levels of expertise and different operating systems being used).</p>

						<p> The exploit relies on using a host machine to target a simulated IoT device running ConnMan, the vulnerable software. My solution was to create an Amazon Machine Instance (AMI), which is an AWS virtual machine; in my design, the AMI acts as the host machine while the simulated IoT device is a Docker Container. I installed Docker on the AMI and ssh'd over necessary scripts for the avticity's exploits, such as the Dockerfile to set up the Container and a malicious DNS server python script. With one AMI properly configured for the event, I made 40 copies. Accessing an AMI requires two things: 1) a .pem file and 2) a specific, unique command to enter on your host machine. For the event, I created a master spreadsheet that included both (1) and (2) for all 40 of the AMI's. I created a master document (shown below) that included instructions for accessing an AMI, in addition to all necessary commands for the exploit. The instructions in this document were both explicit and clear enough that participants with nearly 0 computer science experience were able to complete the activities and walk away with some knowledge. </p>
